            <h3>Arrow function and normal function difference</h3>
            <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>

            <h3> var let const difference</h3>
            <p><b>Let:</b> The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually alow to reassign.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Const:</b>The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that canâ€™t be reassigned.
                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>var :</b> The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                    Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global variables are available throughout your entire code.

            <h3>Why you used template string?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Template string </b> :
                when we write multiline string to need template string?and when we need use varable or dynamic data through the string.
